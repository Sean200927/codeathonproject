o What	problem	does	your	app	solve?
  Our app, Mentor, seeks to solve the issue that graduating seniors are at a loss of what to do once they graduate. You've basically been in school non-stop from the age or 5 or so and once you're finished you'll have the feelings of excitement for being done and for the accomplishment that you just achieced. At the same time you have this fear of what's next?
  
o How	does	your	app	solve	that	problem?
  Our app will pair students with an industry mentor starting in their junior year of schooling. The mentor will already have gone through this process so they can relate to the student on a way that others can't. They will also be able to provide their knowledge of the industry and give the student some hints and tips so that when they graduate they'll come out better than a student without a mentor.
